Guess That Number Game

This is a JavaScript game where the user has to guess a random number that is generated with information that supplied by the user. The user specifies the range and the number of attempts to guess the number. 
The only modification added to this "code along project" is that it will tell you how many attempts took the user to guess the number (when the guesses are less than attempts set and if the number is guessed).
